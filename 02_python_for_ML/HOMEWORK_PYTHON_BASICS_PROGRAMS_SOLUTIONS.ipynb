        "These small building blocks repeat in many programs. If you understand this section, the code will feel much easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1) Clean coding standards (simple rules)\n",
        "- **Use clear variable names**: `total`, `count`, `largest`, `arr` (avoid `x1`, `temp2` unless needed).\n",
        "- **One task per line**: it becomes easy to read and debug.\n",
        "- **Add short comments** where students usually get confused (input parsing, loop updates).\n",
        "- **Match output format exactly** (space-separated vs one per line), because many assignments are auto-checked.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2) `input()` always gives a string\n",
        "- `input()` reads one line from the user.\n",
        "- Even if you type `10`, Python reads it as the string `'10'`.\n",
        "- So we convert using `int()` or `float()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3) `int()` and `float()` (type conversion)\n",
        "- `int('10')` → `10` (integer)\n",
        "- `float('2.5')` → `2.5` (decimal)\n",
        "- Use **`int`** when the question says \"integer\".\n",
        "- Use **`float`** when decimals are possible (radius, temperature, interest).\n",

        "### 4) `split()` (break a line into parts)\n",
        "- When input is space-separated like: `10 25`\n",
        "- `input().split()` converts it to a list of strings: `['10', '25']`\n",

        "### 5) `map()` (apply a function to each item)\n",
        "- `map(int, input().split())` means:\n",

        "- This gives an actual Python list of integers.\n",
        "\n",

        "- `print(a, b)` prints with a space by default: `a b`\n",
        "- To print a list space-separated, we often do:\n",
        "  - `print(' '.join(map(str, arr)))`\n",
        "- Why `map(str, arr)`? Because `join` works only with strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8) `range()` in loops\n",
        "- `range(1, 11)` gives numbers **1 to 10** (11 is not included).\n",
        "- Used in multiplication table and counting loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9) `for` loop vs `while` loop\n",
        "- Use **`for`** when you know how many times to repeat (like 10 times, or 1..N).\n",
        "- Use **`while`** when you repeat until something becomes false (like `while n > 0` for digit problems).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10) String slicing `s[::-1]`\n",
        "- `s[::-1]` means: take the string with step `-1` (reverse direction).\n",
        "- Used to reverse strings and check palindrome.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 11) List slicing (used in rotation)\n",
        "- `arr[-K:]` means last `K` items.\n",

        "### 12) Common beginner mistakes to avoid\n",
        "- Don’t write `map[int](...)` (wrong). Correct is `map(int, ...)`.\n",
        "- Don’t forget to convert input: `'5' + '6'` becomes `'56'` (string), but `5 + 6` is `11`.\n",
